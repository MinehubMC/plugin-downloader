# Plugin Downloader

This was created to ease the management of multiple different plugin versions for minecraft servers. Before this we had to manually update the download URLs in github action workflows, now they can all be managed in a single .json file.

## Usage

`plugin-downloader --config <dependency .json file path> --out <output folder>`

Default values are: `./dependencies.json` and `.` for the output folder.

### Usage in a github action workflow
